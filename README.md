Minimum System Requirements
--------------------------------------------------------------

* Intel(i3) or AMD(phenom ii) *(Processor support is not guarnteed, should run on systems that support workstation pro/player)
* 8 GB system RAM *(can work in less ram but smooth performance is not possible)
* Windows 7 64-bit
* 50 GB Hard Disk Space

* Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 3
* 16 GB system RAM *(12 GB can be allocated to Mac VM)
* Windows 10 64-bit
* 50 GB space on SSD or SSHD


***The Mac VM does not support 3d graphics acceleration and can't be allocated more than 128 MB Vram. So don't try to run Final Cut Pro or Adobe Premiere. If anyone want to do a Virtual GPU Passthrough, goodluck with that :D
